Solution is not specified.
Usage:
  tps invoke [options] <solution-path>

Description:
  Invokes a solution against the (already generated) test cases.

Options:
  -h, --help
	Shows this help.
  -s, --sensitive
	Terminates on the first error and shows the error details.
  -w, --warning-sensitive
	Terminates on the first warning or error and shows the details.
  -r, --show-reason
	Displays the reason for not being correct.
	The checker message is written in the case of wrong answer.
  -t, --test=<test-name-pattern>
	Invokes only tests matching the given pattern. Examples: 1-01, '1-*', '1-0?'
	Multiple patterns can be given using commas or pipes. Examples: '1-01, 2-*', '?-01|*2|0-*'
	Note: Use quotation marks or escaping (with '\') when using wildcards in the pattern to prevent shell expansion.
	      Also, use escaping (with '\') when separating multiple patterns using pipes.
      --tests-dir=<tests-directory-path>
	Overrides the location of the tests directory
      --no-check
	Skips running the checker on solution outputs.
      --no-sol-compile
	Skips compiling the solution.
	Uses the solution already compiled and available in the sandbox.
      --no-tle
	Removes the default time limit on the execution of the solution.
	Actually, a limit of 24 hours is applied.
      --time-limit=<time-limit>
	Overrides the (soft) time limit on the solution execution.
	Given in seconds, e.g. --time-limit=1.2 means 1.2 seconds
      --hard-time-limit=<hard-time-limit>
	Solution process will be killed after <hard-time-limit> seconds.
	Defaults to <time-limit> + 2.
	Note: The hard time limit must be greater than the (soft) time limit.
